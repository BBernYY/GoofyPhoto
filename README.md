encodes text into images
## how to use
use the encode() and decode() functions
## info
* I used ISO-8859-1 because i live in the Netherlands but feel free to change the version! (it wont work with encodings above 8 bits, because of the image bit depth always being 8, It's a pain to change it, and 4-bit or lower encoding will be stored less efficiently than 8-bit)
